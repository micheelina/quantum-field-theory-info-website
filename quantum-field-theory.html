	<p>Hey Everyone,<br><br> This website is designed for those who are interested in physics and such fun things. 
		I took an approach to give quick facts about Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Mechanics and why 
		it is important for everyone to take a moment to think about the world in a different way.</p>

    			<dd><p>1 Physics apply quantum theory to, esp. form into quanta, in particular restrict the number of possible values of (a quantity) or states of (a system) so that certain variables can assume only certain discrete magnitudes.
2 Electronics approximate (a continuously varying signal) by one whose amplitude is restricted to a prescribed set of values.</p></dd>
